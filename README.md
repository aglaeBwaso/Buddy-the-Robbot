Finally, the settings fragment is accessible with a button on the 3 different fragments at the top-right corner (but not visible for the moment). The consumer will be able to change the colour of the application, if he want to change his planning by adding or deleting a heading in it. Also, he will be able to add some music or change the voice of the robot in "Preferred Settings".
